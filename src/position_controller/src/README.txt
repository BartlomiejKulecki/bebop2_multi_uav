There are 3 possible drone pose info sources:

odom - PID controller uses drone odometry
Sphinx - PID controller uses drone pose from simulator
optitrack - PID controller uses drone pose from motion capture system

Select one of the option and number of drones you want to run and copy cpp file from appropriate directory (replace current file).
